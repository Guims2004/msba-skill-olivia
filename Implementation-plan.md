**What does this repo do in plain language?**

This repository uses SQL queries to look at data from an online store. It helps find customers who might stop buying from the company (churn). 
The code calculates things like how long a customer has been with the store and how much they spend. 
This is important because it tells the business which customers are unhappy or at risk of leaving.

**What would you need to change to use it for a real company?**

To use this for a real company, I would need to make these changes:

Live Data: Instead of using a static file, I would connect the SQL code to the company's real-time database (like Snowflake or Google BigQuery).

Automation: I would set up a system to run these queries automatically every week so the marketing team always has fresh information.

Privacy: I would make sure to protect private customer information (like names and emails) to follow security rules.
